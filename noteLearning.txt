function:
1)from sklearn.datasets import load_svmlight_file
example: 
	train_X,train_y=load_svmlight_file(train_file)
	
2)???
	import pcorrelation as pcorr
	pcorr.corrcoef_result(train_x,train_y)  // don't get it    read codes ahead

3)???
	import infortancegain as info
	infogain=info.infogain_result(train_x,train_y) //
